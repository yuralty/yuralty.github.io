I am Tianyuan Liu, currently a Ph.D. graduate from the Department of
Computer Science, UIUC. I was advised with professor [Klara Nahrstedt](http://cairo.cs.illinois.edu/klara.html). My research interest includes cyber-physical systems, trusted execution environment and applied cryptography.

Check my full CV [here](http://yuralty.github.io/resume.pdf).
